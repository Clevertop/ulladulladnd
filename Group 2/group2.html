                            to rid a house of ghosts/supernatural entities. We agreed and headed off to the house. After arriving we stumbled into one of the rooms and were greeted with a loud voice: "Prepare to die mortals" (or something along those
                            lines I cant remember exactly). In the same room we also found a trapdoor, At the time it was locked so we kept looking aroundthe house. After some time 3 monsters emerged from the trapdoor and started attacking us, we defeated
                            them and finished exploring the ground floor of the house. we then moved on through the trapdoor to the cellar and encountered two more monsters which we also defeated (we still need to collect XP and loot their bodies) we

                        <p><strong><em>Week 2 Session Recap:</em></strong><br>well it's time for the session recap of week 2, here we go. Today was first session with Duncan as he had been away for the first week so we started off todays story by following
                            Otis who has been walking for many days from Seaton, as he was approaching Saltmarsh he heard screams coming from the mansion that our adventures were searching. Quickly he ran in to find out what was happening, as he walked
                            upstairs the calls got louder eventually leading him to Ned (after a near death experience with a nest of spiders actually he just closed the doors and that stopped the spiders from chasing him). Ned was tied up and after a
                            few minutes of asking him questions like "Do you watch JoJo's bizarre adventure?" he finally decided to free him. Otis then walked down the stairs and into the basement confronting the adventurers who had just defeated two
                            goblins. After joining with the party they continued searching the basement of the house. In one of the rooms that Codus (Tom) was searching they found a bullseye lantern, a note about some Morse code and 3 books. Now these
                            books - you see - two of them were completely normal books worth 10gp each but the third? That was a book of erotic poetry. Immediately Lan (Jack) grabbed this book starting an hour long debate/haggle as Nacromac (Cameron)
                            and Otis wanted this book. meanwhile the party opened the final room they could see which had a group of about 8 skeletons. These skeletons started attacking the party but eventually the party defeated them notably one of the
                            skeletons had a glowing blue stone, 4 vials of acid, and a bag of holding. A few minutes after defeating them Nacromac, Otis and Lan finally struck a trade deal for the erotic poetry book. Lan would give them the book in return
                            for a vial of holy water (25gp) and 4 golden rib bones from the skeletons (20gp total) [the book was originally worth 10gp]. with the last 20 minutes of the session the adventures found 2 secret rooms.(edited)[8:17 PM]The first
                            contained the lab in which the vials of acid were made as well as a few objects made of solid gold like a skull and apple. Then Lan banged on the door to the second secret room and called "Who's in there!" rolling a 1 on an

                        <p><strong><em>Week 3 Session Recap:</em></strong><br>In this session Kriziki(Lorry) joins the party and they continue searching the haunted mansion. As we entered the cave system connected to the basement Codus almost got burnt by
                            naturally growing acid that was falling from the ceiling but luckily avoided it with a dexterity save. A few rooms later they came across Sanabelt, the wizard who had taken over the mansion. After attempted peace talks a fight
                            broke out! After a few turns Otis, Codus, Nacromac and Lancer where all knocked unconscious. Codus was stabilized with "Spare the Dying" from Kriziki, Otis was brought back to life with 1HP by rolling a 20 and Lancer was stabilized
                            after the fight ended. Unfortunately Nacromac suffered a normal death save fail and then a critical fail causing his character to die :(. after a few more turn Sanabelt and his goons were defeated ending the fight. <br><br><strong>Notable Items Found:</strong><br>None!<br><br><strong>Next Session:</strong><br>-

                        <p><strong><em>Week  3B Session Recap:</em></strong><br>This session picks up immediately after ending the fight with Sanabelt. After quickly searching through the remainder of the loot (Sanabelt and the boat) the party quickly stuffed
                            Nacromac and Sanabelt's head into the bag of holding so that could easily take them with them. Then they quickly travelled back to the town in hopes of reviving Nacromac. After talking to the priest the adventures found out
                            it would cost a diamond worth 500gp to perform the revive. Over the next week the adventures did what they could to raise the money:<br><br><strong>Codus:</strong><br>Codus attempted to sell the Luckstone he had found in the
                            house and was offered 400gp for it. Later that week Codus went to complete the trade but was not able to get in as the door was locked. using mage hand he unlocked the door and discovered that she was dead. He quickly backed
                            out removing all traces that he had been inside but was then stopped by the deliverer who was about to deliver the diamond. The deliverer unlocked the door and saw the she was dead. Codus pretended he didnt already know and
                            went to the town hall to let the authorities know. He also sold a bunch of items to the deliverer for 115gp and attempted to complete the trade with him but was unable to as the stone would not leave his person.<br><br><strong>Lance:</strong><br>Lance

                            enchanted dice. Otis went first and bet 20gp and won (F,S,S) with a profit of 10gp - But then a high stakes gambler walked in and demanded a game with Otis. To avoid playing this risky game Otis threw up on the table.<br>Then
                            it was Kriziki's turn. He bet 10gp and lost 5gp (S,F,F).<br><br>They then all went back to the town hall and collected their reward of 200gp plus a bonus 200gp because of all the smuggled goods.<br>Finally after all this they

                        <p><br><strong><em>Week 4A Session Recap:</em></strong> (Apr 1)<br>After completing their first quest the party were recruited by the council to try and take down more of the smuggling operation. First they were sent back to the mansion
                            to wait until the boat came then after 11 days the smugglers ship was seen about a kilometer offshore. It was also signalling the "Is it safe" morse code ( - . . . ). In reply the adventures sent back "everything safe" ( .
                            - . - ) after an hour the ship sent a final "ready to unload come to ship" message ( - - - ) and it was time for the party to move into phase two of their plan. <strong>The Plan:</strong> the party would use the provided rowboat
                            to get close to the ship then Lancer and Smoke would jump off and try to board the boat while the crew weren't watching and the rest of the party would go through the normal entrance and pretend to be smugglers aswell. this
                            all went fine until one of the crew noticed that there should be a second ship that would come to give goods to the smugglers. Unfortunately due to poor persuasion a fight quickly broke out. A few turns into combat Otis fell
                            unconscious from a Longsword hit from Captain Sigurd (19 Damage) then Codus dealt just enough sleep damage to put the captain to sleep with a sleep spell (27) and within a few more turns every enemy on the top deck was dead
                            or asleep. Now it is time for our adventures to clear the three lower decks<br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>None!<br><br><strong>Next Session:</strong><br>"Restore health to Otis"<br>"Explore and clear

                        <p><br><strong><em>Week 4B Session Recap:</em></strong> (Apr 5)<br>This session the party continued clearing out the ship. While searching Lance found a group of humanoid lizard people who seemed to be customers of the smugglers.
                            after carefully talking to them Lance backed out of the room and left them be. A few minutes later the party decided to tackle the main room with 5 smugglers in it that they had seen before. First Codus used burning hands on
                            four of them and instantly killed two of them, unfortunately this set the table and hammocks on fire. The rest of the party moved in and killed the rest within a few turns and after the fight the fire was put out quickly. In
                            the next room they found a significantly more difficult enemy which took many turns to defeat and also downed Nacromac. Finnaly the party checked the lowest floor of the ship which seemed to have a floor made of sand with a
                            shallow pool of water ontop. After seeing a shiny gold glint Lance and Smoke walked in to try and get this but as they were waling towards it two Rot Grub Swarms started attacking them. One of these swarms bit Smoke and three
                            of the grubs started burrowing in. Smoke quickly retreated upstairs to where the rest of us were but at that point the grubs that had burrowed attacked her for 17 points of damage making her unconscious. Eventually the party
                            killed the rest of the swarm meaning the entire ship has been cleared except for the dragon/lizard people.<br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>None! (But there is lots of loot we could get from the ship)<br><strong>Next Session:</strong><br>"Restore

                        <p><br><strong><em>Week 5A Session Recap:</em></strong> (Apr 9)<br>Following clearing all the smugglers from the ship the adventurers talked to the lizard people to try and find out what they wanted. It turns out that they were customers
                            to the smugglers and they were buying weapons so after a quick chat Lance let them look around the ship for their weapons. while the lizard people were doing this the party tried to find loot for themselves. Codus found a few
                            books and a locked box in one room and then in another room Lance and Kriziki tried to open a chest but released toxic green gas which made them both unconscious for 4 minutes. After they woke up they found a purse with 50gp,
                            a spell scroll with Gust of Wind on it and a Spellbook. After this one of the lizard people discovered a secret room which contained the weapons they were seeking, they also found an elf named Oceanus. After finding the weapons
                            the lizard people gave the payment for the weapons to Lance. The payment was 10 electrum ingots (worth 500gp). This was divided <em>very fairly</em> with 5 ingots going to Lance and 1 ingot each for everyone else. (it was divided
                            this way as apparently he was the only person who wasn't planning to kill them?)<br><strong>For the record:</strong><br>Lance wanted to release them<br>Codus wanted to lock them in so they couldn't surprise attack us<br>Nacromac

                        <p><br><strong><em>Week 5B Session Recap:</em></strong> (Apr 11)<br>At the start of this session the adventures collected their reward of 250gp from the council and were given a new quest. The council now wanted the party to to clear
                            a dwarven mine of orcs, as payment the party will recive the ship they cleared last time! Quickly the part made their way to the mine and uon arriving they spotted smoke coming out of a small cave and went to investigate. It
                            seemed to be coming out of a small gap in the rock so after scouting out the area with Krizikis flight and Codus' owl they decended into the cave with some rope. After checking their surroundings and solving dynamic lighting
                            problems. After checking through the first room they found a pair of dwaven people theat must have been captured by the orcs. some of the party members attempted to break the lock by hitting it with their weapons but the sound
                            of the lock being hit alerted a few orcs of the party's presence. the party quickly defeated these normal orcs but then Jack's wifi broke and he was disconected. during this time Lancer went into a dreamlike state and started
                            unconciously walking around the caves but still mostly following the parties instuction but then Lancer walked into a room with 5 orcs and 1 special strong orc. As soon as the orcs saw him they started chasing him into the
                            central room where we found the prisoners and the rest of the party quickly rushed back to try and help him. The first to arrive was Codus' Owl who electrocuted one of the orcs but then got hit and dissapeared into a puff of
                            smoke. Soon after, the rest of the party arrived and helped Lancer fight the orcs. Within the first few seconds of the fight there was a flurry of blows, Otis was downed, Codus killed one of the orcs and Kriziki attempted to
                            use Inflict wounds on big blue but unfortunately rolled a 1, 2 and 3 on the 3d10 damage dice (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXatAoqb7II">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXatAoqb7II</a>). After this Nacromac and Kriziki
                            also get downed.(edited)[5:08 PM]At this point things were going south very quickly but luckly Codus used sleep on big blue and made him fall asleep as well as two of the orcs. This meant there was only one orc still fighting
                            and Lancer quickly killed it. Then smoke and Lancer killed the other three orcs before the sleep wore off and Codus stabalized the rest of the party. <br><br>Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MHaqdI4jc4&amp;t=256s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MHaqdI4jc4&amp;t=256s</a><br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>None!

                            before going to sleep. Two hours in a couple of orcs stumbled upon the group. quickly the conscious party members killed the two orcs and finished their rest. After the rest they continued exploring and found a secret passage
                            to a small room which had two orcs and a magic orc which were also quickly killed. The magic one happened to have alchemists fire. The party then moved into an impressive chamber with 30ft high ceiling and also a huge rift
                            descends with dozens of stone steps descending into the darkness. As they are admiring the room the party is attacked by four Stirge's which codus put to sleep and were finished off by the other party members. In the north
                            of the room was another wooden door but when Lance opened it he set off a fire trap which slightly hurt Kriziki and Himself. after disarming the trap they were able to enter and found some barrels filled with flammable liquid
                            so he took 12 cups of it. Then the adventures descended into the rift.<br><br>Recording: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AROJ6y-nmQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AROJ6y-nmQ</a><br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>+

                            they found a large statue of a fierce looking dwarf but as Otis went up to take a closer look at it he accidently triggered a gas trap which poisoned him for a few minutes. After carefully disarming the trap the group continued
                            in what seemed to be a room where the dwarves would sleep. While in the room Nacromac found a secret stash containing 250sp, 40gp and a Handaxe with a strange mark on it. Codus had a look at the markings and discovered it was
                            the mark of Durgeddin , a famous dwarf smith. Due to this he decided it was probably magical. The adventures then moved onto the next room which had a strong heavy door which after attempting to do an investigation check, we
                            discovered, was in fact, a door. After finding out this important information Otis slammed the door open with a nat 20 strength check and found a small chamber which was inhabited by two Dire Wolf's and the great Ulfe who immediately
                            started attacking. At one point Nacromac cast Hideous laughter which stopped the great Ulfe from attacking for almost the whole battle. After this the fight ended quickly with only Nacromac and Otis being downed. Immediately
                            after the battle the group was jumped by a group of orcs who picked up the unconscious bodies of Otis and Nacromac and threatened to kill them if the rest of the party did not drop their weapons. After a few minutes of discussion
                            the party begrudgingly obliged and dropped their weapons. they were then led back to the cell that the two prisoners were in near the entrance to the cave and locked in. The adventures were now trapped without any of their

                        <p><br><strong><em>Week 7A Session Recap</em></strong> (Apr 23)<br>At the start of this session the party short rested so that they would get some of their hp back. After doing this Lance made his way over to the cell we were trapped
                            in and took out the Orc who had the key. He then unlocked the cell and released the rest of the party. The group then moved to the only part of the first floor they hadn't explored yet, took out the orc that was asleep and
                            recollected their items. After this the group rushed back to Saltmarsh because they were worried the town may attempt to pay the orcs for our freedom which would be bad. As they walked into the council building they ran into
                            one of the orcs that had captured them! Quickly Lance called out to the nearby guards to capture him but after a few seconds of fighting the orc killed itself by running into a guards spear so that it would go into the endless
                            war afterlife of its god.<br>After this the party continued to talk to the council people to let them know that no bounty was need to be paid. Before the adventures continued back to the cave they bought some healing kits,
                            inquired about health potions at Keledek tower and Lance started searching for magic items. After this they went back to the fortress/cave but as they entered the lower floor Kriziki was attacked by 4 Stirges which had the
                            advantage of surprise and landed all their hits, downing Kriziki. The rest flew away.<br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>+ All our gear<br>+ 135 gp each<br>+ Topaz<br>+ 2x Onyx<br>+ Potion of climbing<br>+

                        <p><br><strong><em>Week 7B Session Recap</em></strong> (Apr 25)<br>In this session our 6 adventures continued clearing the 2nd floor of the fortress. The first thing they did was flow the path of the stream that ran down the centre
                            of the room. Lance swam through the opening at the southern side of the room and found a long open area but was also attacked by a pair of troglodyte's who were camouflaged on the cave walls. Although the party had to be careful
                            not to get to close and be poisoned they easily defeated the two monsters. They then continued following the stream and reached a room where they found a Giant Subterranean Lizard that was chained into the room, next two it
                            were two iron chests so the adventures initally attempted to calm it down but their attempts were unsuccessful so instead Lance attempted to run out and drag one of the chests back. While he was doing this the lizard attacked
                            with its long tail dealing 14 damage and knocked him over then on its next turn it tried to bite Lancer and knocked him unconscious. If the lizard got another turn while Lancer was still unconscious Lance would be swallowed
                            so Kriziki healed Lancer and Lancer managed to escape the lizards mouth. Next Otis played his bagpipes with a nat 20 performance check and scared the lizard making it move to the back of the cave. But then then lizard strained
                            at the chain holding him back and broke it. The lizard was now free and started chasing the group through the cave but at this stage it was also very weak so the party quickly finished it off. In the chest was 2200sp, a potion
                            of climbing and a potion of underwater breathing. Next the party continued to where the stream turned into a waterfall and found a set of plate armour on the ground. Suddenly as they got close the armor came alive and started
                            attacking but since it was only one enemy it wasn't too difficult to defeat. After this they used a short rest as they were tired after fighting through the three encounters.(edited)[4:44 PM]After the rest they went up the
                            stairs in the chamber with the waterfall and found a large room with many coffins that looked liked they contained the remains of ancient dwarves. At the end of the room there were three special coffins that were each marked
                            with the writing "Doom awaits any who dares to defy the honorable dead". Naturally Kriziki immediately starts opening the generic coffins but doesnt find anything of use inside so he moved onto the special ones with the warnings,
                            the first one had a golden ring on so he attempted to take the ring as quickly as possible but in his haste he accidently brought the entire hand with him (nat 1 slight of hand)! after this he opened the second and third ones
                            and found an ancient dwarven warhammer so considering what had just happened he tried to take it aswell again rolling a nat 1 and taking the hands and arms of the ancient dwarf with him! <br><br>double nat 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRBV2uP6pIk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRBV2uP6pIk</a><br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>+

                        <p><br><strong><em>Week 8A Session Recap</em></strong> (Apr 29)<br>After last weeks grave robbing session the party continued to explore. They moved North West from the coffin room where they were attacked by Two troglodyte and a
                            brown bear. Although Smoke was downed the adventurers quickly eliminated the two weaker monsters and were about the fight the bear when Otis decided to try and tame it with his ration packs. On his checks he rolled a 18,6,20,10,16
                            and 18 successfully taming the bear and named it Fozzie. Although at this stage he cannot control it but the bear will not attack them. While Otis was doing this Codus, Smoke and Lance searched some of the nearby rooms and
                            discovered a small cavern filled with fungus like that found in other parts of the cave but also gold-brown moss which was covering two corpses. In the first skeletons grasp was a gleaming sword which appeared to be magical.
                            After a moment Codus used mage hand to pick up the sword but while he was picking it up he slightly disturbed the moss releasing poisonous spores into the air and hit Lancer. Instantly this poisoned Lancer and damaged him for
                            15 hitpoints, additionally after a medicine check from Codus they discovered that it would most likely be fatal if the poison was not removed quickly, after a - discussion - Kriziki removed the poison from Lancer moments before
                            he would have taken fatal damage. After further analyzing the sword some more they noticed that it also had the symbol of Durgeddin. Before they left the area Codus used mage hand one more time to collect two vials of the mold
                            which was found to be Yesquero Mold. These vials could be thrown at enemies to cause the effects on them! At the end of the session the group attempted to short rest so that they could heal and have a look at the sword but
                            15 minutes in they were stopped when they were attacked by 6 Troglodytes.(edited)[6:45 PM]<strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>+ A bear<br>+ Mustard Gas grenades x2<br>+ Magic Sword with mark of Durgeddin<br>+ Silver

                    <p><br><strong><em>Week 8B Session Recap</em></strong> (May 2)<br>15 minutes into their rest the party was ambushed by 6 troglodytes, all coming from diffrent areas of the caves. As they were picking them off one by one a mysterious elf
                        appeared and started attacking the Troglodytes. Soon after this they finished off the rest of the monsters. Immediately Naromac introduced himself to the elf and found that his name was Denise and after a very short discussion
                        Denise joined the party! Next the group finished their short rest that had been interrupted last time. After the rest they walked back to the big open room that was covered in mushrooms as there were many unexplored areas here.
                        Naromac was at the front and climbed up one of the small rocky walls but as he reached the top he was attacked by a Grick which pounced on him and reduced him to 1hp quickly the rest of the party caught up and tried to help Naromac.
                        Otis ran in to help but as he approached Naromac another Grick appeared and knocked Otis unconscious. With no-one close enough to save him Naromac was hit again by the grick and also knocked unconcious. additionally both Otis and
                        Naromac were bitten after being knocked so they both failed a death save. On naromacs next turn he failed another death save leaving him very close to death. Luckily Kriziki arrived moments after this and was able to use Prayer
                        of healing to heal both of them. Otis was able to disengage and escape before the grick had a chance to react but Naromac was not so lucky and was attacked again falling unconcious for the second time and just like before the grick
                        bit naromac leaving him with 1 failed death save. The tragically on naromacs turn he rolled a nat 1 on the death saving throw killing his character just like before. After a few more rounds of combat the party killed the two gricks
                        and tried to decide what to do next.(edited)[4:42 PM]<strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>- Lost Naromac <br>+ Denise Joined<br><strong>Next Session:</strong><br>"Introduce Camerons new character, Dio"<br>"Finish clearing

                    <p><br><strong><em>Week 9A Session Recap</em></strong> (May 6)<br>Following the tragic events of the last session the remainder of the group needed to decide what to do with the lifeless body of Namorac. The group slowly head back to
                        the church and cemetery and decided to bury him there. The next morning the priest of the church hosted the funeral and all was progressing well until a strange person yells "father!", runs into the cemetery, announces himself
                        as Dio and demands his fathers belongings. Codus, who currently had Naromac's items, was shocked by this and denied handing them over as everyone was unsure if this person was really a descendent of Naromac. Lancer started shouting
                        at this newcomer and quickly it escalated to to Dio attempting to push Lancer into the Grave. Luckily lancer held his balance and did not fall in. Eventually the group was able to verify that Dio was in fact the son of Naromac
                        and handed over the Items. After the mornings events the group proceeded to check a few shops around town. Codus, Otis, Dio and Kriziki spoke to the guy selling potions and Kriziki bought 3 (?) for 50gp each. Lancer and Smoke visited
                        the faithful quartermasters of Tarn to check on the magic items Lancer was searching for a few days ago <strong>SEE BELOW</strong>. After this they headed back to the Drawven Fortress to continue(edited)[8:39 PM]their quest. Near
                        where Naromac fell a strong iron door was found and after picking it open the group moved forward and found a large staircase leading up to a higher floor of the caves. After climbing to the top the adventures found themselves
                        in a octagonal room with three statues guarding two doors. Codus attempted to open one of the doors with mage hand but as he attempted to open it the two statues next to it slammed down on the hand. They quickly realized it was
                        a trap and after searching the room they found a secret entrance in one of the walls. After going through a small tunnel they found themselves in a large chamber with a throne at the end of the room and three creatures that looked
                        kind of like dwarves'. When they saw the party they shouted "Go back where you came. This is the only warning you'll get!" so they retreated back into the tunnel but before the door closed Codus casts Invisibility on smoke.(edited)[8:40

                    <p><br><strong><em>Week 10A Session Recap</em></strong> (May 13)<br>This session picks up immediately after the adventures defeated the first set of evil dwarves'. Previously Codus had been interrogating the one that surrendered so he
                        demanded that it led us to their most valuable items. The dwarf did this and led us to a large room with a stream running through the centre and two bridges crossing the stream at the two sides of the room. Unfortunately the dwarf
                        had also led us to three more enemies and one of them was a caster. Smoke and Lancer were busy talking to Idallla so they were unable to help during the fight, this led to Otis being downed but only for a few seconds before being
                        healed again. Although time consuming the adventures eventually defeated all four of the dwarfs didn't let any of the surrender and found 320gp 1100sp and a gold necklace set with ruby stones worth 900gp. After moving on from this
                        room they decided to explore some of the rooms in the northern parts of the fortress but as they passed the dark pool a ghostly figure appeared! quickly everyone rushed to the nearest room so that they could hide but unfortunately
                        the ghost can go straight through walls and found Codus, Kriziki and Otis. Upon seeing all the dead dwarven bodies in the room the ghost was shocked and peeled back her face to try and frighten the 3 people. Otis and Codus passed
                        their saves but Kriziki was scared by the ghost and instantly aged ten years! (Note: the amount kriziki would age was based off a 1d4 x 10 years roll. Aarakocra only live for an average for an average of 30 years and Kriziki was
                        around 10 years old so if the d4 had rolled a 3 or a 4 Kriziki would have instantly died of old age!) after this encounter the party tried to take out the giant carpet by using vials of oil and fire to burn it to death. This was
                        very successful and after(edited)[8:56 AM]eliminating this threat they discovered that the room was not looted and found a star sapphire worth 500gp and a pair of blue topazes worth 90gp each. But then suddenly they heard a scream
                        from the room Smoke, Lancer and Idalla were in quickly they ran to see what had happened and saw Idalla had dissapeared and Lancer was attacking Smoke!<br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>+ Lots of gold<br>+

                        a safe position and prepared for him to come out of the study room. Otis set a rope trap, Codus set a reaction to attack with magic missile as soon as he opened the door. and smoke prepared to fire her crossbow while Hedwig flew
                        around the room trying to find the now seemingly invisible Idalla. When it came round to Lancers turn he moved forward as predicted was hit by magic missile and damaged a bit. He then fired his crossbow at codus but missed. Just
                        before his next turn Idalla re-appeared and gestured to shoot Hedwig, the owl. Since he was still being mind controlled he complied but missed his shot. Iddalla was unhappy with this and proceeded to poison kiss him instantly killing
                        Lancer. Now the party could see Iddalla they were able to focus the rest of their efforts on eliminating her. Codus discovered that she was no turning invisible but switching between the material and the ethereal plane so everyone
                        prepared to attack wherever she may appear and Dio successfully seduced her out of hiding by reading his erotic poetry book. After this the party were eventually able to reduce her to 0 hit points and kill her. So the fight was
                        successful but lancer had been killed so they quickly travelled back to the town, bought another 500gp diamond with some of the treasure they had collected over the past few days and brought him back to life at the church. After
                        this they continued back to the fortress to one of the lower floors and started exploring where the waterfall led to but suddenly a blue dragon rose out of the water and started attacking them![1:38 PM]<strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>-

                        a while He and Lancer (the only two people that could speak to the dragon) tried to persuade the dragon to let them pass as they could see a valuable treasure hoard&gt; Unfortunately the dragon would not let the party pass so Dio
                        threw a topaz into the air and everyone started attacking it. Immediately the dragon used its breath weapon and dealt 46 Damage to both Lancer and Smoke making them both unconcious. Quickly Kriziki brought them back with healing

                        to get gaurunteed damage and Ots Kriziki and Lancer were downed but eventually Codus was able to put the dragon to sleep with a sleep spell and Kriziki stabbed it finishing it off. <br><br><strong>Notable Items Found / Lost:</strong><br>+

                        the title deeds for the boat. Upon arriving back in saltmarsh the party started a couple weeks of downtime. Kriziki went to the Faithful Quartermasters of Tarn (FQoT) and purchased a headband of intellect for 300gp, Otis and Dio
                        started getting the dragon head cleaned and de-scaled, Kriziki looked for more magic items, smoke while Codus copied some spells, set up the yesquro mold plant and went to Anders house to try and request to join the council. After
                        completing downtime a person came to the boat and requested that Codus and Dio follow him for a meeting with Gellan Primewater. This man led them to a back room in one of the saltmarsh taverns where Gellan Primewater was waiting.

                        was happening a large group of people were gathering outside the council building. They soon found out that a group of sailors had been lost at sea and likely captured by pirates. The council decided that they could not spare resources
                        to send out a search party for them meaning the only way they would be saved was if the party helped them<br><br>The party voted 3:1 for the ghost pirates/ship so they started that quest and the next morning they set off. A week
                        later the group found the ghost ship just drifting around the sea. Quietly they board the ship and start searching for the box. In the first room there are 4 corpses that have a strange milky white sheen, as they start moving inside
                        the room the corpses get up and start fighting. After a few rounds the zombies were defeated but Codus Kriziki &amp; Smoke failed their constitution saving throws against perhaps some kind of disease.<br><br>Just before finishing
                        the session the party finished searching the room and found the captains log which had many hints on what caused the zombies and what they can do. Specifically on "283rd Year After Unison, 24th of Anokis" it had this entry "Ship
                        once again capable of extended travel. Still uncertain of precise location, but “anywhere but here” will suffice for now. However, additional problem has presented itself. Almost all rations on board have become rotten and diseased.

                    <p><br><strong><em>Week 14 Session Recap</em></strong> (June 20) [Written by Duncan]<br>We all went down to the next level of the ship and investigated a room which was full of tiny spiders and four human sized web sacks. Kriziki used
                        a fire cantrip to cut one of them down, and a demon frog thing came out of it. The other sacks opened and had the same things inside. during the battle, both smoke and lancer were downed, but after the battle kriziki used some
                        big healing spell and everyone gained 20 health. Both kriziki and smoke suddenly became afflicted by something that ruined their skin or something you'll have to ask marcus and it lowered both their charisma and constitution. Kriziki
                        got a nat 20 on a medicine check but still couldn't cure it because she didn't have any spell slots open, so we chucked her back on the ship. Oh yeah and Dio is still a badger. The team was now Otis, badger, lancer and smoke, and
                        we checked another room and it was full of spiders. Dio got a nat 20 on an intimidate, but nothing really happened. another door was opened, this one having an orc, two giant green spiders and a giant white spider. we lured them
                        to the top deck where lancer negotiated with the orc to take him back to land and feed him.<br><br><strong>Next Session:</strong><br>"heal kriziki and smoke" <br>"find the black box" <br>"Maybe try and get the orc to sail with

                        in the bottom deck of the ship so Lancer, Smoke and Codus went down there and Lancer tried to find the box but after a minute of unsuccessful searching 4 Ghasts appeared from the dark waters NOT Minecraft Ghasts and started attacking.
                        Unfortunately Lancer was downed as he was surrounded by the four monsters and the DM rolled a nat 20. He rolled his first death save and got a nat 1 so when it was Codus's turn he sent Hedwig to feed Lancer a healing potion. Another
                        ghast attacked Lancer and also rolled a nat 20. then like the first time he rolled a nat 1 on his first death save. Then on the turn after he tragically rolled a third nat 1 killing him. Quickly Dio shouted out to the Orc for help.
                        The Orc responded by jumping over the side of the ship and teleporting into the bottom of the ship through the water climbs out and Revivifies Lancer. Finally they defeat the remaining ghasts and they find the black Box. But immediately
                        after they touch it a Kraken starts attacking the ship. The crew on the crimson dragon are terrified by this and attempt to sail off without the party.<br>Before they get too far away Codus uses sleep on the person who was at the
